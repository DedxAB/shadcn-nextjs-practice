# Group Routing

## Understanding Group Routes

**Key Concepts:**

- **Declaration:** Group routes are declared within parentheses: `()`.
- **Group Name vs. Route:** The text within the parentheses is the group name, **not** a route itself.
- **Route Definition:** The actual routes are defined within folders named after the group.
