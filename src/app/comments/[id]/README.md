# Understanding HTTP Request Object and Route Parameters in Next.js

This README provides an understanding of how the HTTP request object and route parameters are used in Next.js.

## HTTP Request Object

In Next.js, the HTTP request object is represented by the `_req` parameter in a function. Even if it's not being used in the function, it's important to include it as a placeholder for the request object. 

If you're concerned about having an unused variable, a common practice is to prefix unused variables with an underscore (`_`), as you've done with `_req`. This signals to other developers that the variable is intentionally unused.

## Route Parameters

Next.js uses the `params` object from the request to get the route parameters. In the following function, the `params` object is used to get the `id` parameter from the route:

```javascript
export async function GET(_req, { params }) {
  const { id } = params;
  const comment = comments.find((comment) => comment.id === Number(id));
  return Response.json(comment);
}

## Removing the Request Object Parameter

If you remove the _req parameter, it could lead to unexpected behavior. This is because Next.js will still pass the request object as the first argument. So, if your function is expecting to use the params object from the request, and you remove _req, then params would actually be assigned the request object, not the params object.
