# Parallel Routes
Parallel routes in Next.js allow you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages within the same layout. They are useful for highly dynamic sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites. 

Before the inception of parallel routes, web developers were limited in how they could structure and display content dynamically on a single view. Traditional routing mechanisms were fairly linear: one URL, one view. This posed challenges, especially when developers wanted to display multiple segments of a website simultaneously or conditionally.

## How Parallel routes are defined?
Parallel routes are defined using a feature known as slots. Slots help structure our content in a modular fashion. To define a slot, we use the `@folder` naming convention. Each slot is then passed as a prop to its corresponding `layout.tsx` file.

In the context of your code, if you want to use parallel routes, you could define different slots for `children`, `notification`, `settings`, `user`, and `login`. Then, depending on the state of `isLoggedin`, you could render different combinations of these slots simultaneously or conditionally. This would give your dashboard a sense of fluidity and responsiveness, especially if certain components take longer due to fetching data or rendering.
