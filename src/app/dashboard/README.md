# Parallel Routes
Parallel routes in Next.js allow you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages within the same layout¹. They are useful for highly dynamic sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites¹. 

Before the inception of parallel routes, web developers were limited in how they could structure and display content dynamically on a single view. Traditional routing mechanisms were fairly linear: one URL, one view². This posed challenges, especially when developers wanted to display multiple segments of a website simultaneously or conditionally².

## How Parallel routes are defined?
Parallel routes are defined using a feature known as slots³. Slots help structure our content in a modular fashion³. To define a slot, we use the `@folder` naming convention. Each slot is then passed as a prop to its corresponding `layout.tsx` file³.

In the context of your code, if you want to use parallel routes, you could define different slots for `children`, `notification`, `settings`, `user`, and `login`. Then, depending on the state of `isLoggedin`, you could render different combinations of these slots simultaneously or conditionally. This would give your dashboard a sense of fluidity and responsiveness, especially if certain components take longer due to fetching data or rendering².
