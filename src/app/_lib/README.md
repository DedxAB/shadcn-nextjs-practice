# Private Route

In our application, we have a concept of "Private Route". This is used to restrict access to certain parts of our application.

For instance, `_lib` is a private route. This means that the end user cannot search using this route. It's designed this way to ensure the security and proper functionality of our application.

Please note that trying to access a private route directly can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
